## Aims and scope

- supporting new research in the field of high-fidelity CFD methods by providing verification cases to aid development and improvement of codes
- identifying pacing items in high-fidelity methods and peripheral tools that need additional research and development in order to proliferate in the CFD community
- facilitating collaboration and enhance mutual understanding among CFD researchers and practitioners in academia, government, and industry

## SciTech 2024 workshop

The workshop will be held in conjunction with SciTech 2024 in Orlando, Florida. Precise dates for the workshop will be updated here once confirmed.


## Test suites

The workshop is structured as a collection of test suites in different technical areas. A special session was held at SciTech 2023 where each test suite documented their respective objectives and test campaigns. Those reference documents are accessible here:

- [RANS](papers/rans.pdf)
- [LES](papers/les.pdf)
- [Mesh Motion](papers/mesh_motion.pdf)
- [SuperHypersonic](papers/superhypersonic.pdf)


## Participation and engagement

Please reach out to test suite leads to express interest in participating. The test suite leads are:

- RANS (Marshall Galbraith galbramc@mit.edu)
- LES (Johan Larsson jola@umd.edu)
- Mesh Motion (Nathan Wukie nathan.wukie@us.af.mil)
- SuperHypersonic (Matt Zahr mzahr@nd.edu)

Each test suite will conduct monthly collaboration meetings over 2023 leading up to the workshop in 2024. Those meeting schedules will be posted here for any interested participants to join. These will be posted around the beginning of February 2023 so please look back soon.


## Test suite resources

Each test suite is outfitted with it's own github repository to facilitate communication, data dissemination and collection. The repositories for individual test suites can be found at:
