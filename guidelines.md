# Presentation guidelines

Each test suite section for the in-person workshop is generally structured as follows:

  - Test suite overview presentation (given by test suite leads)
  - Individual participant presentations (5-8 minutes each, given by participants)
  - Test suite results summary and discussion (given by test suite leads)

The goal of individual presentations is to communicate details of your methodology related to a given test suite. Please no presentation of results as those should be included in the test-suite results summary presentations that will be given by the test suite leads. Please see the non-mandatory reference template provided for individual presentations [Presentation Template](resources/HiFiCFDWorkshopPresentationGuidelines.pptx)
