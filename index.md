## SciTech 2023 pre-workshop special session

A pre-workshop special session will be held in conjuction with SciTech 2023. Each test suite will present an overview of the suite objectives and outline the test campaign. The resultant manuscript will serve as documentation for test suite participants.

## Test suites

The workshop is structured as a collection of test suites in different areas. Each test suite is outfitted with it's own github repository to facilitate communication, data dissemination and collection. The repositories for individual test suites can be found at:

- [RANS](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024RANS)
- [LES](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024LES)
