title: High-Fidelity CFD Verification Workshop <br> (SciTech 2024)
---

## Aims and scope

- supporting new research in the field of high-fidelity CFD methods by providing verification cases to aid development and improvement of codes
- identifying pacing items in high-fidelity methods and peripheral tools that need additional research and development in order to proliferate in the CFD community
- facilitating collaboration and enhance mutual understanding among CFD researchers and practitioners in academia, government, and industry

## SciTech 2024 workshop

The workshop will be held in conjunction with SciTech 2024 in Orlando, Florida. Precise dates for the workshop will be updated here once confirmed.

## SciTech 2023 pre-workshop special session

A pre-workshop special session will be held in conjuction with SciTech 2023. Each test suite will present an overview of the suite objectives and outline the test campaign. The resultant manuscript will serve as documentation for test suite participants.

## Test suites

The workshop is structured as a collection of test suites in different areas. Each test suite is outfitted with it's own github repository to facilitate communication, data dissemination and collection. The repositories for individual test suites can be found at:

- [RANS](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024RANS)
- [LES](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024LES)
- [Mesh Motion](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024MeshMotion)
- [SuperHypersonic](https://github.com/HighFidelityCFDVerificationWorkshop/2024SuperHypersonic)
