## Aims and scope

- supporting new research in the field of high-fidelity CFD methods by providing verification cases to aid development and improvement of codes
- identifying pacing items in high-fidelity methods and peripheral tools that need additional research and development in order to proliferate in the CFD community
- facilitating collaboration and enhance mutual understanding among CFD researchers and practitioners in academia, government, and industry

## 2024 Workshop

The workshop will be held over two days January 6-7, 2024 in conjunction with SciTech 2024 in Orlando, Florida.

Registration will be conducted via AIAA's SciTech 2024 registration once it becomes available.

## Test suites

The workshop is structured as a collection of test suites in different technical areas. A special session was held at SciTech 2023 where each test suite documented their respective objectives and test campaigns. Those reference documents are accessible here:

- [RANS](papers/rans.pdf)
- [LES](papers/les.pdf)
- [Mesh Motion](papers/mesh_motion.pdf)
- [SuperHypersonic](papers/superhypersonic.pdf)


## Participation and engagement

Please reach out to test suite leads to express interest in participating! **Student participation is also very welcome.** The test suite leads are:

- **RANS lead:** Marshall Galbraith galbramc@mit.edu
- **LES lead:** Johan Larsson jola@umd.edu
- **Mesh Motion lead:** Nathan Wukie nathan.wukie@us.af.mil
- **SuperHypersonic lead:** Matt Zahr mzahr@nd.edu

Individual test suites meet regularly and are the perfect opportunity for interested participants to get involved. The meeting schedules are

- **RANS meetings:** Bi-monthly on Tuesdays at 10am US Eastern Time Zone. Please contact Marshall Galbraith (galbramc@mit.edu) or Boris Diskin (boris.diskin@nianet.org) for a virtual meeting link.
- **Mesh Motion meetings:** First Wednesday of every month at 3pm US Eastern Time Zone. https://meet.google.com/gtj-uqum-mzu
- **LES meetings:** First Monday of every month at 12pm (noon) US Eastern Time. https://umd.zoom.us/j/4487374796
- **SuperHypersonic meetings:** Second Thursday of every month at 11am Eastern Time Zone. Please contact Matt Zahr (mzahr@nd.edu) or Kevin Holst (kevin.holst@utk.edu) for a virtual meeting link.
